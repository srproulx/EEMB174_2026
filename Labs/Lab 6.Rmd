# Bayesian Statistical Modeling Winter 2026
# Lab Exercise, Week 7

*When is this lab due?* Labs are due on the Thursday after they are assigned. However, in many cases you can complete them during the lab period itself.   This assignment is due on Thursday, 2/26/2026.  




## The Metropolis algorithm 
Here is the code from the book to run a simple implementation of the algorithm. It requires a function that we are trying to measure, which is the way that population size varies by island. In general, it is often possible to evaluate our function of interest (the posterior probability density function) for specific input values, but not easy to find the regions where the function has high values, especially when the function is multidimensional. Here we will be working with functions that we define and know everything about already, just to demonstrate that the algorithm can find their shape.

### A simple linear function
We will start with the example from the book, one where the size of the islands we are visiting is equal to the index number of that island. We will setup a tibble that holds the island index number `location` and the island `size`
```{r , eval=FALSE}
popsize=tibble(location=seq(1:10),size=seq(1:10))
num_islands=nrow(popsize)
```

Let's give it a look:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(popsize, aes(x=location,y=size)) + geom_line()
```
Great, we know what it looks like :) But we also want to re-scale it so that it can represent frequencies, which means sum to one. The trick to this is to find the normalizing constant which is the sum of the `size` column.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
norm=sum(popsize$size) 

popsize <- mutate(popsize,frequency = size/norm)

sum(popsize$frequency)
```

So we can see what it would look like expressed as frequency, this is the frequency we want our algorithm to give us back when it explores the landscape.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(popsize, aes(x=location,y=frequency)) + geom_line()
```
### Walking through the algorithm by single steps

Start off at island 10 and set the value of current to the current position:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
positions <- tibble(week=1,position=10)

current=positions$position
cur_week=2
```

First decide to test moving to the left (move of -1) or right (move of +1)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(378484)
(flip<-sample( c(-1,1) , size=1 ))
```



With this random seed, we move right, i.e. from 10 to 11
Now get the position of the proposal move
```{r, eval=FALSE}
 (proposal <- current + flip)

```
But 11 might not be a real position, because we have wrapped around the top of our circle of islands, so we check this and figure out that we are actually testing island 1:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
 if ( proposal < 1 ) proposal <- num_islands
    if ( proposal > num_islands ) proposal <- 1

proposal
```

Now we calculate the probability of moving, which is one if the proposal island has a larger size, and is the ratio of the population sizes on the islands we are comparing otherwise. First we calculate the ratio of populations sizes:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
 (prob_move <- popsize[popsize$location==proposal,]$size/popsize[popsize$location==current,]$size)
```
Island 1 is 0.1 as big as island 10, so we have a 10% chance of moving to that island.

We move if a random draw (uniform(0,1)) is less than the value of `prob_move`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
(current <- ifelse( runif(1) < prob_move , proposal , current ))
```
Our random draw was bigger than 0.1, so we stay on island 10.

And now we record our position and add it to the list:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
(positions <- rbind(positions,c(cur_week,current)))

cur_week<-cur_week+1
```
#### Question 1
Run through this process again, you can cut and paste most of it, but make sure you both understand what each bit of code is doing, and the specific outcome you get. Write in text explaining what and why the algorithm is doing.





#### Question 2
See how many samples it takes to get the a distribution that is similar to our expectation. Here is code to do it for a 10 week sampling period.

This generates the sequence of moves:
```{r , eval=FALSE}
num_weeks<-5000
positions<- tibble(week=seq(num_weeks),location=rep(0,num_weeks)) # make an tibble to record our progress in
current <- 10 # starting location

for ( i in 1:num_weeks ) {
  ## record current position
    positions$location[i] <- current
  ## flip coin to generate proposal
    proposal <- current + sample( c(-1,1) , size=1 )
  ## now make sure he loops around the archipelago
    if ( proposal < 1 ) proposal <- num_islands
    if ( proposal > num_islands ) proposal <- 1
  ## move?
    prob_move <- popsize[popsize$location==proposal,]$size/popsize[popsize$location==current,]$size
    current <- ifelse( runif(1) < prob_move , proposal , current )
}
```

This plots the sequence path:
```{r , eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data= positions , aes(x=week,y=location))+
  geom_line()
```
And this compares the histogram of the sampled islands to the frequency in the original function:

```{r , eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=positions, aes(x=location))+
  geom_histogram(bins=10)+
  geom_line(data=tibble(location=seq(1:10),count=seq(1:10))%>%
              mutate(count=count*num_weeks/norm),inherit.aes = F, aes(x=location,y=count))
```

Re-create these plots for 100, 500, 1000, and 5000 weeks. How well does it match? How could you quantify the match?

#### Question 3: A more difficult archipelago to study
Here we define an island chain that is going to be more difficult for the algorithm to map, because it has two separate islands that are way bigger than their neighbors. I'm giving you the code to run multiple markov chains and then combine them.

Your job for this question is to interpret the results verbally.

First we set up the islands with two very large islands:
```{r , eval=FALSE}
popsize=tibble(location=seq(1,14),size=c(0.1,1,10,100,10,1,0.1,0.1,0.1,1,10,100,10,0.1))

norm=sum(popsize$size)
```


And we will run 5 different Markov chains, starting right in between the two big islands.
```{r , eval=FALSE}
num_weeks <- 1e4
reps=5
chains=list()

for(j in 1:reps){ 
positions<- tibble(week=seq(num_weeks),location=rep(0,num_weeks))
current <- 8
for ( i in 1:num_weeks ) {
  ## record current position
    positions$location[i] <- current
  ## flip coin to generate proposal
    proposal <- current + sample( c(-1,1) , size=1 )
  ## now make sure he loops around the archipelago
    if ( proposal < 1 ) proposal <- 14
    if ( proposal > 14 ) proposal <- 1
  ## move?
    prob_move <- popsize[popsize$location==proposal,]$size/popsize[popsize$location==current,]$size
    current <- ifelse( runif(1) < prob_move , proposal , current )
}

chains[[j]]  <- positions
}

```


We can plot the sequence of islands visited for each chain:
```{r , eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=chains[[1]] , aes(x=week,y=location))+
  geom_line(color="red",alpha=0.5)+
  geom_line(data=chains[[2]],color="blue",alpha=0.5)+
  geom_line(data=chains[[3]],color="green",alpha=0.5)+
  geom_line(data=chains[[4]],color="yellow",alpha=0.5)+
  geom_line(data=chains[[5]],color="purple",alpha=0.5)
```

We can also look at the histograms:
```{r , eval=FALSE}

ggplot(data=chains[[1]] , aes(x=location))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 14,fill="red",alpha=0.5)+
  geom_histogram(data=chains[[2]],bins = 14,fill="blue",alpha=0.5)+
  geom_histogram(data=chains[[3]],bins = 14,fill="green",alpha=0.5)+
  geom_histogram(data=chains[[4]],bins = 14,fill="yellow",alpha=0.5)+
  geom_histogram(data=chains[[5]],bins = 14,fill="purple",alpha=0.5)
```
From the sequences or the histograms, what do you see? How do they compare to each other?



And now we'll put the chains together and summarize them:
```{r , eval=FALSE}
combined_chains=chains[[1]]
for(i in 2:5){
  combined_chains=bind_rows(combined_chains,chains[[i]])
}

ggplot(data=combined_chains , aes(x=location))+
  geom_histogram(bins=14 )+
  geom_line(data=popsize%>%
              mutate(count=size*num_weeks*reps/norm),inherit.aes = F, aes(x=location,y=count))

```
How do you think the algorithm did on this surface?

#### Question 4: Try your own surface
Make up your own "population size surface". You can make it longer or shorter. Create a set of plots as we did for the other surfaces and gauge how well the algorithm was able to match your function.



### Using Ulam to run MCMC models
`ulam` uses syntax that is based on the same principles as `quap`. The main difference is that we can specify how many separate chains we want to run and how many samples to generate from that chain. 

We will run the example of estimating human height regressed on weight.  First load the data and create standardized versions of the variables:
```{r}
data("Howell1")
d<-Howell1
d2<- as_tibble(d)%>% filter(age>=18)%>%
  mutate(heightS=standardize(height),weightS=standardize(weight))
```


Now run the `ulam` model. The syntax is almost the same as for `quap`, with the addition of instructions for how to run the mcmc algorithm. These include how many interations and chains, and also to store the log likelihood in order to calculate things like WAIC and LOOIC later.
```{r}
ulam_model_height <- ulam(
  alist(
    heightS ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu <- a +bw*weightS,
    a ~ dnorm( 0 , 4 ) ,
    bw ~ dnorm(0,3),
    sigma ~ dunif( 0 , 50 ) 
  ) , data=d2 , iter=3000, cores=4, chains = 4,log_lik = T)
```


We can still use `precis` to see a summary:
```{r}
precis(ulam_model_height)
```

The output is similar to when we run `quap`, but we have two new columns, `n_eff` and `Rhat`.

`n_eff` is a measure of how many independent samples from the posterior we have. It is an attempt to correct for correlations in the data. If `n_eff` is small compared to the number of iterations you ran, there may be a problem. Here we ran 3000*4 iterations, but half of them were in the warm up phase and not included. So the algorithm will return 6000 samples. The effective number of samples will be less than this, and this reduction reflects the efficiency of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. We would like `n_eff` to generally be above 1000. Remember when we did the simulations of the Metropolis algorithm, we needed like 1000 samples to get a pretty good match for a simple surface.

`Rhat` is a measure of how much agreement between chains there is, and is supposed to tell you that the Markov chains have "converged". When this number is above 1 then there may be a problem. In practice it is often between 1 and 1.1.

Let's take a closer look at what actually comes out of the stan run. The object that we get out of `ulam` has a bunch of extra information attached to it, but for now we just want to see the samples that came out of the algorithm. We take the `@stanfit` part of the `ulam` object. Then we use the `rstan::extract` function to get a dataframe that has all of the samples. It has a column for each parameter we are fitting and as many rows as were sampled (in this case 500).
```{r}
posterior.samples <- rethinking::extract.samples( ulam_model_height@cstanfit) %>% as_tibble()

```


Now we have our samples, and like before we can work directly with them. For instance we can plot a histogram of the intercept values:
```{r}
ggplot(posterior.samples,aes(x=a))+geom_histogram(bins=20)
```

#### A model where the intercept also depends on sex
Now we want to continue to use ulam but for a more involved model where height is a linear function of weight, but the intercept depends on sex. Draw the picture of what you want your models to be able to do and then write the ulam function (use log_lik=T)


```{r}
ulam_model_height_sex_varint <- ulam(
  alist(
   CODE HERE
    sigma ~ dunif( 0 , 50 ) 
  ) , data=d2 , iter=3000, cores=4, chains = 4,log_lik = T)
```

```{r}
precis(ulam_model_height_sex_varint)
```


#### A model where the slope depends on sex, but not the intercept
For this model, height is a linear function of weight, but the slope depends on sex. Draw the picture of what you want your models to be able to do and then write the ulam function (use log_lik=T)

```{r}
ulam_model_height_sex_varslope <- ulam(
  alist(
   CODE HERE
    sigma ~ dunif( 0 , 50 ) 
  ) , data=d2 , iter=3000, cores=4, chains = 4,log_lik = T)
```


#### A "full interaciton" model of height as a function of weight and sex
Now we want to continue to use ulam but for a more involved model with an interaction between weight and sex. The idea is to consider a scenario where the linear regression depends on sex, basically that we have two separate linear regressions, one for female people and the other for male people. You can code this by using an indicator variable of male/not male to multiply by the parameters that apply to male or female individuals. 


```{r}
ulam_model_heightXsex <- ulam(
  alist(
    heightS ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu <- af*(1-male) +am*male + bf*(1-male)*weightS+bm*male*weightS,
    af ~ dnorm( 0 , 4 ) ,
    am ~ dnorm(0,4),
    bf ~ dnorm(0,3),
    bm ~ dnorm(0,3),
    sigma ~ dunif( 0 , 50 ) 
  ) , data=d2 , iter=3000, cores=4, chains = 4,log_lik = T)
```

```{r}
precis(ulam_model_heightXsex)
```

#### Compare the WAIC of these models
Now use the 'compare' function to compare these models based on their WAIC. What does it show?
